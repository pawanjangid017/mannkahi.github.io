                Section shall survive even after the termination or expiry of the Policy and/or
                Terms.</p>
            <p class="pregrap"><b>a) Mediation:</b> In case of any dispute between the parties, the Parties will attempt
                to resolve the same amicably amongst themselves, to the
                mutual satisfaction of both Parties. In the event that the Parties are
                unable to reach such an amicable solution within thirty (30) days of one Party communicating the
                existence of a dispute to the other Party, the
                dispute will be resolved by arbitration, as detailed here in below;</p>
            <p class="pregrap"><b> b) Arbitration.</b> In the event that the Parties are unable to amicably

                arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the Firm, and the
                award passed by such sole arbitrator will be valid and binding on both
                Parties. The Parties shall bear their own costs for the proceedings,
                although the sole arbitrator may, in his/her sole discretion, direct either
                Party to bear the entire cost of the proceedings. The arbitration shall be
                conducted in English, and the seat of Arbitration shall be in Jodhpur,
